A user has an IAM policy as well as an Amazon SQS policy that apply to his account. The IAM policy grants his account permission for the <code>ReceiveMessage</code> action on <code>example_queue</code>, whereas the Amazon SQS policy gives his account permission for the <code>SendMessage</code> action on the same queue.

An IT company is using AWS CloudFormation to manage its IT infrastructure. It has created a template to provision a stack with a VPC and a subnet. The output value of this subnet has to be used in another stack.
As a Developer Associate, which of the following options would you suggest to provide this information to another stack?

Use 'Expose' field in the Output section of the stack's template
Use Fn::ImportValue
-Use 'Export' field in the Output section of the stack's template
Use Fn::Transform

A developer is migrating an on-premises application to AWS Cloud. The application currently processes user uploads and uploads them to a local directory on the server. All such file uploads must be saved and then made available to all instances in an Auto Scaling group.
As a Developer Associate, which of the following options would you recommend for this use-case?

Use Amazon EBS as the storage volume and share the files via file synchronization software
Use Instance Store type of EC2 instances and share the files via file synchronization software
-Use Amazon S3 and make code changes in the application so all uploads are put on S3
Use Amazon EBS and configure the application AMI to use a snapshot of the same EBS instance while launching new instances

For an application that stores personal health information (PHI) in an encrypted Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance, a developer wants to improve its performance by caching frequently accessed data and adding the ability to sort or rank the cached datasets.
What is the best approach to meet these requirements subject to the constraint that the PHI stays encrypted at all times?

Migrate the frequently accessed data to DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) that has encryption enabled for data in transit and at rest
-Store the frequently accessed data in an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis instance with encryption enabled for data in transit and at rest
Store the frequently accessed data in an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached instance with encryption enabled for data in transit and at rest
Migrate the frequently accessed data to an EC2 Instance Store that has encryption enabled for data in transit and at rest

=================================================================================================================================================

A company wants to add geospatial capabilities to the cache layer, along with query capabilities and an ability to horizontally scale. The company uses Amazon RDS as the database tier.
Which solution is optimal for this use-case?

-Leverage the capabilities offered by ElastiCache for Redis with cluster mode enabled
Migrate to Amazon DynamoDB to utilize the automatically integrated DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) along with query capability features
Leverage the capabilities offered by ElastiCache for Redis with cluster mode disabled
Use CloudFront caching to cater to demands of increasing workloads

You have a Java-based application running on EC2 instances loaded with AWS CodeDeploy agents. You are considering different options for deployment, one is the flexibility that allows for incremental deployment of your new application versions and replaces existing versions in the EC2 instances. The other option is a strategy in which an Auto Scaling group is used to perform a deployment.
Which of the following options will allow you to deploy in this manner? (Select two)

-Blue/green Deployment
Pilot Light Deployment
Cattle Deployment
-In-place Deployment
Warm Standby Deployment

You are working on a project that has over 100 dependencies. Every time your AWS CodeBuild runs a build step it has to resolve Java dependencies from external Ivy repositories which take a long time. Your manager wants to speed this process up in AWS CodeBuild.
Which of the following will help you do this with minimal effort?

Use Instance Store type of EC2 instances to facilitate internal dependency cache
Reduce the number of dependencies
-Cache dependencies on S3
Ship all the dependencies as part of the source code

Write a cron job that will execute a Lambda function at a scheduled time and insert the records into DynamoDB
-Create an S3 event to invoke a Lambda function that inserts records into DynamoDB
Set up an event with Amazon CloudWatch Events that will monitor the S3 bucket and then insert the records into DynamoDB
