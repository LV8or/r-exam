A user has an IAM policy as well as an Amazon SQS policy that apply to his account. The IAM policy grants his account permission for the <code>ReceiveMessage</code> action on <code>example_queue</code>, whereas the Amazon SQS policy gives his account permission for the <code>SendMessage</code> action on the same queue.

A developer is migrating an on-premises application to AWS Cloud. The application currently processes user uploads and uploads them to a local directory on the server. All such file uploads must be saved and then made available to all instances in an Auto Scaling group.
As a Developer Associate, which of the following options would you recommend for this use-case?

Use Amazon EBS as the storage volume and share the files via file synchronization software
Use Instance Store type of EC2 instances and share the files via file synchronization software
-Use Amazon S3 and make code changes in the application so all uploads are put on S3
Use Amazon EBS and configure the application AMI to use a snapshot of the same EBS instance while launching new instances

For an application that stores personal health information (PHI) in an encrypted Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance, a developer wants to improve its performance by caching frequently accessed data and adding the ability to sort or rank the cached datasets.
What is the best approach to meet these requirements subject to the constraint that the PHI stays encrypted at all times?

Migrate the frequently accessed data to DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) that has encryption enabled for data in transit and at rest
-Store the frequently accessed data in an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis instance with encryption enabled for data in transit and at rest
Store the frequently accessed data in an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached instance with encryption enabled for data in transit and at rest
Migrate the frequently accessed data to an EC2 Instance Store that has encryption enabled for data in transit and at rest

=================================================================================================================================================

A company wants to add geospatial capabilities to the cache layer, along with query capabilities and an ability to horizontally scale. The company uses Amazon RDS as the database tier.
Which solution is optimal for this use-case?

-Leverage the capabilities offered by ElastiCache for Redis with cluster mode enabled
Migrate to Amazon DynamoDB to utilize the automatically integrated DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) along with query capability features
Leverage the capabilities offered by ElastiCache for Redis with cluster mode disabled
Use CloudFront caching to cater to demands of increasing workloads

You have a Java-based application running on EC2 instances loaded with AWS CodeDeploy agents. You are considering different options for deployment, one is the flexibility that allows for incremental deployment of your new application versions and replaces existing versions in the EC2 instances. The other option is a strategy in which an Auto Scaling group is used to perform a deployment.
Which of the following options will allow you to deploy in this manner? (Select two)

-Blue/green Deployment
Pilot Light Deployment
Cattle Deployment
-In-place Deployment
Warm Standby Deployment
