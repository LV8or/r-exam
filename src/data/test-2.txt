A company has created an Amazon S3 bucket that holds customer data. The team lead has just enabled access logging to this bucket. The bucket size has grown substantially after starting access logging. Since no new files have been added to the bucket, the perplexed team lead is looking for an answer.
Which of the following reasons explains this behavior?

-S3 access logging is pointing to the same bucket and is responsible for the substantial growth of bucket size
A DDoS attack on your S3 bucket can potentially blow up the size of data in the bucket if the bucket security is compromised during the attack
Erroneous Bucket policies for batch uploads can sometimes be responsible for the exponential growth of S3 Bucket size
Object Encryption has been enabled and each object is stored twice as part of this configuration
