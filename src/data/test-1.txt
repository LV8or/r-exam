The development team has just configured and attached the IAM policy needed to access AWS Billing and Cost Management for all users under the Finance department. But, the users are unable to see AWS Billing and Cost Management service in the AWS console.
What could be the reason for this issue?

-You need to activate IAM user access to the Billing and Cost Management console for all the users who need access
IAM user should be created under AWS Billing and Cost Management and not under AWS account to have access to Billing console
The users might have another policy that restricts them from accessing the Billing information

A development team has configured inbound traffic for the relevant ports in both the Security Group of the EC2 instance as well as the Network Access Control List (NACL) of the subnet for the EC2 instance. The team is, however, unable to connect to the service running on the Amazon EC2 instance.
As a developer associate, which of the following will you recommend to fix this issue?

Rules associated with Network ACLs should never be modified from the command line. An attempt to modify rules from the command line blocks the rule and results in an erratic behavior
-Security Groups are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Network ACLs are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic
IAM Role defined in the Security Group is different from the IAM Role that is given access in the Network ACLs
Network ACLs are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Security Groups are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic

A multi-national company has just moved to AWS Cloud and it has configured forecast-based AWS Budgets alerts for cost management. However, no alerts have been received even though the account and the budgets have been created almost three weeks ago.\

Budget forecast has been created from an account that does not have enough privileges
-AWS requires approximately 5 weeks of usage data to generate budget forecasts
Account has to be part of AWS Organizations to receive AWS Budgets alerts

Which of the following best describes how KMS Encryption works?

-KMS stores the CMK, and receives data from the clients, which it encrypts and sends back
KMS receives CMK from the client at every Encrypt call, and encrypts the data with that
KMS generates a new CMK for each Encrypt call and encrypts the data with it
KMS sends the CMK to the client, which performs the encryption and then deletes the CMK

An IT company is configuring Auto Scaling for its Amazon EC2 instances spread across different AZs and Regions.
Which of the following scenarios are NOT correct about EC2 Auto Scaling? (Select two)

-An Auto Scaling group can contain EC2 instances in only one Availability Zone of a Region
-Auto Scaling groups that span across multiple Regions need to be enabled for all the Regions specified
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to distribute instances evenly between the Availability Zones that are enabled for your Auto Scaling group
For Auto Scaling groups in a VPC, the EC2 instances are launched in subnets
An Auto Scaling group can contain EC2 instances in one or more Availability Zones within the same Region

What of the following is the MOST optimal solution to address this use-case?

Use boto3 dependency injection
-Use the --region parameter
You should create a new IAM user just for that other region
You need to override the default region by using aws configure
